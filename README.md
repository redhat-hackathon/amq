# Red Hat AMQ for Messaging

## What is it?

Red Hat AMQ provides lightweight, high-performance, event-based messaging platform for enterprise applications.

AMQ Streams in particular is a Java/Scala publish-subscribe-based messaging broker. Based on the [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) project, offers a distributed backbone that allows microservices and other applications to share data with extremely high throughput and extremely low latency.
